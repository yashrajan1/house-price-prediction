# House Price Prediction

This project is part of my internship with **YBI Foundation** in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

## Project Objective
To build a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on features from the Boston Housing dataset.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Boston Housing Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv)
- **Features Used**: 
  - `rm` (average number of rooms per dwelling)
  - `lstat` (% lower status of the population)
  - `ptratio` (pupil-teacher ratio by town)
- **Target**: `medv` (median value of owner-occupied homes)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building using Linear Regression
5. Model Evaluation using R² and RMSE
6. Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Prices

## Results
- **R² Score**: ~0.85
- **RMSE**: ~34,000

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `house_price_prediction.py` using Python 3
